Tic Tac Toe Game Setup Guide
This guide will help you create a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow the steps below to get started.

Project Structure
Create the following files and directories in your project directory:

tic-tac-toe/
│
├── index.html
├── app.js
└── index.css
Step 1: Add HTML Content
Create index.html: This file will contain the structure of your web page.
Add HTML elements: Include elements such as the title, player input fields, the game board, a message display, and a button to start a new game.
Step 2: Add CSS Styling
Create index.css: This file will contain the styling for your web page.
Style the game board: Use CSS Grid to create a 3x3 grid for the Tic Tac Toe cells.
Style the cells: Ensure the cells are clickable, centered, and have a border.
Style the body and other elements: Center the body content, set the font, and style the player information and message display.
Step 3: Add JavaScript Logic
Create app.js: This file will contain the game logic and interactions.
Set up the game state: Initialize variables to track the current player, board state, and player scores.
Handle cell clicks: Add event listeners to the cells to handle player moves and update the board state.
Check for a win: Implement a function to check if the current player has won the game.
Update scores: Update the player's score when they win.
Reset the board: Clear the board and reset the game state when starting a new game or after a win/draw.
Display messages: Update the message display to show the winner or a draw message.
Step 4: Link the Files
Link index.css: Include the CSS file in the HTML head section to apply the styles.
Link app.js: Include the JavaScript file at the end of the HTML body to add the game functionality.
Step 5: Test the Game
Open index.html in your web browser: You should see the Tic Tac Toe board, player name inputs, scores, and a "Start New Game" button.
Play the game: Click on the cells to play. Players should alternate between "X" and "O".
Check the message display: When a player wins, their name should be displayed as the winner. In case of a draw, a draw message should be displayed.
Update player names: Type in the input fields to change player names.
Check the scores: Scores should update correctly when a player wins.
Click "Start New Game": The board should reset, and scores should reset to 0.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game with player names, score tracking, and in-page messages. This guide should make it easy for anyone to set up and create the game from scratch.
